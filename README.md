# ðŸŽ¶ Ly-Lyric App

Ly-Lyric App is an interactive platform powered by **Snowflake Cortex Search**, **Mistral-large2** and **Streamlit** designed for music enthusiasts and lyricists. Discover songs, generate creative lyrics, explore stories behind songs, translate lyrics into multiple languages, and much more.

While the app leverages advanced **LLM (Large Language Model)** capabilities for creative generation and translations, some outputs may vary in accuracy and should be considered as creative suggestions rather than absolute interpretations.

> Data used for this project is from the github repo [Open Lyrics Database](https://github.com/Lyrics/lyrics-database). Being used for experimental purpose in this project.

> Submission for hackathon - RAG 'n' ROLL Amp up Search with Snowflake & Mistral ( https://snowflake-mistral-rag.devpost.com/ )
